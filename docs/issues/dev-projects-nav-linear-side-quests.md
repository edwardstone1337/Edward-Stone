# Dev Projects: Navigation + Linear Style + Side Quests

**TL;DR** — Bring navigation over to the dev-projects (or relevant) area and match it to the theme. Use a Linear-style nav (clean, minimal). Group case studies under a new heading (e.g. "Side quests" / "View side quests") and bring in the new elements.

**Type:** feature  
**Priority:** normal  
**Effort:** medium

---

## Current State

- Navigation may live elsewhere or not be fully integrated in this context
- Case studies / side projects not grouped under a dedicated heading
- Theme consistency with nav and new elements unclear

## Expected Outcome

- **Navigation** — Brought over and themed to match the page/site
- **Linear style** — Nav feels like Linear: clean, minimal, modern
- **Case studies** — Under a new section heading (e.g. "Side quests", "View side quests", or whatever we end up calling them)
- **New elements** — All new UI elements (strips, nav, headings) integrated and consistent

## Relevant Files

- `index.html` — layout, nav placement, section headings
- `assets/css/dev-styles.css` — nav and theme styles
- Any shared nav component or partial

## Notes / Risks

- Naming for the case-studies section TBD ("Side quests" vs "View side quests" vs other)
- Linear-style = minimal, good typography, subtle borders/hover; reference Linear.app for feel
