            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p class="case-study-section-subheading">Teachers were overwhelmed by an expanding content library.</p>
            <p>On the Inquisitive platform, the content library was growing quickly. Teachers struggled to find, save and organise what they needed for planning.</p>
            <ul class="case-study-quotes">
              <li>"How can I save units I'm searching?"</li>
              <li>"I keep getting lost trying to bookmark content."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>They needed a way to manage planning without having to navigate the whole site every time.</p>
          </section>

          <section id="the-goal" class="case-study-section">
            <h2>The Goal</h2>
            <p class="case-study-section-subheading">Teachers needed clear, easy-to-access planning tools aligned with the curriculum.</p>
            <p>The primary audience was teachers in Australia and the US. Their needs were:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Simple, clear planning aligned with curriculum standards.</li>
              <li>Quick access to teaching content.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Manual workarounds were time-consuming and didn't scale.</p>
          </section>

          <section id="how-i-did-it" class="case-study-section">
            <h2>How I did it</h2>
            <p class="case-study-section-subheading">Leading end-to-end research and design, collaborating closely with product and development teams.</p>
            <p>I led the design and research for this work. Activities included:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Analyzing jargon queries.</li>
              <li>Conducting interviews and surveys with teachers.</li>
              <li>Prototyping and usability testing.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I worked with the Head of Product and development, using Figma, UserTesting, Dovetail and Zoom. Constraints included desktop, tablet and mobile, and the shift to online teaching during COVID.</p>

          <section id="the-process" class="case-study-section">
            <h2>The Process</h2>
            <p class="case-study-section-subheading">Incremental improvements guided by continuous feedback transformed the tool from simple bookmarking to powerful planning.</p>
            <h3>Starting Simple</h3>
            <p>We began with a straightforward bookmarking-style feature so teachers could save content without extra complexity.</p>
            <h3>Team-Based Organisation</h3>
            <p>The content structure evolved to support how teams actually plan and share units.</p>
            <h3>Prioritizing Units</h3>
            <p>Research showed that unit-level organisation mattered more than individual resources, so we prioritised units in the experience.</p>
            <h3>Featureless Access</h3>
            <p>We introduced a unit-restricted tool and a slide-out drawer so teachers could preview and work with units without leaving their flow.</p>
            <h3>Ongoing Iteration</h3>
            <p>We relied on continuous feedback and regular interviews to refine the product over time.</p>
          </section>

          <section id="the-solution" class="case-study-section">
            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <p class="case-study-section-subheading">A simple, intuitive Planner aligned closely with teachers' real-world workflows.</p>
            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <p>We delivered a set of core features that matched how teachers plan:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Unit-Based Organisation: Direct alignment with teacher workflows.</li>
              <li>Term-Based: Structured planning across school terms.</li>
              <li>Dynamic Overview: Instant unit previews, reducing navigation friction.</li>
              <li>Flexible Reordering: Easy drag and drop adjustments.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Simplicity and clarity were the main design goals.</p>

          <section id="the-outcome" class="case-study-section">
            <h2>The Outcome</h2>
            <p class="case-study-section-subheading">Dramatically improved user retention and satisfaction with clear, measurable impacts.</p>
            <p>The Planner became a central feature: over 90% of teachers use it at least weekly.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Over half of our users use it regularly.</li>
              <li>Users report dramatically improved planning efficiency.</li>
              <li>Support tickets related to planning dropped completely.</li>
              <li>Consistent feedback praises the Planner as "essential" and "a lifesaver".</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The End Result</h2>
            <p class="case-study-section-subheading">Incremental, user-focused improvements can lead to exceptional outcomes.</p>
            <p>Thousands of teachers have saved substantial planning time. The work showed how incremental design, grounded in user research and feedback, can deliver strong results and make a core product feature feel essential.</p>
